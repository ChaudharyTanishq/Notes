\subsection{Automata, Computability, and Compelxity}

\textit{\textbf{What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of 
computers?}}\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Complexity Theory: What makes some problems harder than others?
    \item Computability Theory
    \item Automata theory: Deals with the definations and properties of
        mathematical models of computation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mathematical notions and terminology}

\paragraph{Strings and Languages}

We define an \textbf{alphabet} to be any nonempty finite set. The members of
the alphabet are the \textbf{symbols} of the alphabet. Generally $\sum$ and 
$\Gamma$ are used to designate alphabets.

A \textbf{string over an alphabet} is a finite sequence of symbols from the
alphabet written next to one another and not seperated by commas.
