\section{Social Choice Theory}

$X$ is a set of all alternatives. $X = {1, 2, \dots, k} = [k]$.
$[k]$ will be used to denote a set in this course.\\

$\pi_1 = (3, 2, \dots, k, 4) \rightarrow$ permutation of $X$.\\

$S_k$ = set of permutation of ${1, 2, \dots, k}$

$$
|S_k| = k!
$$

Society consists of $n$ people preferance profile.

$$
\pi = (\pi_1, \pi_2, \dots, \pi_n) \in S_{k}^{n}
$$

Goal: Aggregate $\pi$ to obtain a "good" preferance
for the society

$$
F: S_{k}^{n} \rightarrow S_k
$$

Here $F$ is called Social Choice Function
