\chapter{Boolean Arithematic and The ALU}

\section{ALU: Arithemetic Logic Unit}

The ALU computes a function of the two inputs, and outputs the
result.\\

Which operations should the ALU perform? This is a hardware/software
tradeoff.

\section{Prespectives}

Our ALU is extremly simplified with respect to the industrial
level ALUs. This is because the course emphasises simplicity.\\

Operations like multiplications, division will be left to the
software part of course. The tradeoff is that it will be slower
but more cost effective.\\

The 16-bit adder we make is actually not that efficent, because we
add the first bits, then compute the carry and then go to the next.
This takes a lot of time. A more efficent way is to create lookup
table and use it to computer carries faster: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry-lookahead_adder}{Carry Lookahead Adders}
