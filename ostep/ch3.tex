    \textbf{The Crux: How to Virtualize Memory?}

    How can the OS build this abstraction of a provate, potentially large
    address space for multiple running processes (all sharing memory) on 
    top of a single, physical memoty?
\end{tcolorbox}

Goals of OS while virtualizing memory

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Transparency: How OS implements virtual memory should be invisible
        to the running program.
    \item Efficiency
    \item Protection: A process should not be able to access memory out of
        its virtual memory
\end{enumerate}
