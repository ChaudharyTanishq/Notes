\section{Introduction}

Better and Better solutions to problems.

\subsection{What do we mean by "Problems"?}

It is not easy to define what a problem is. For example, Find the 
next real number to $1.5$. This problem is not well posed.\\

There is a problem of how do you pose problems itself.

Task for next class: Try to discover your own answers to
"what's a problem" in Sequential Algorithms setting.

\subsection{What do we mean by "Solution"}

A well defined sequence of steps that solve the problem is NOT a
correct defination of a computational solution.

Task for next class: Try to discover your own solutions to "what's
a solution" in Sequential Algorithms setting.

\subsection{How to COMPARE various solutions?}
