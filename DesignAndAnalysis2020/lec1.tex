\chapter{Introduction}

The course in one line: Better and Better Solutions to Problem.\\

But to understand this line, we need to define some terms in the
line. 

\subsection{What do we mean by "Problems"?}

Today, we'll try to appreciate what is so difficult
about this question. Challenges: (We talk about sequential problems)

\begin{itemize}
    \item Is it a Computational Problem?
    \item Is the problem well-posed?
    \item The problem of "Posing a problem without solving it"
    \item Infinite Ways of solving the same problem
\end{itemize}

Algorithms today dont only involve sequential problem. The 
challenges posed for sequential problems and the one line defination
also are same for quantum, concurrent algo.

\subsection{What do we mean by "Solution"}

Challenges: (Sequenctial problem)

\begin{itemize}
    \item It it a Computational Solution?
        A sequence of well defined steps which gives an answer
        if NOT a solution.
    \item Discrete vs Continous
    \item Is the Solution Realistic
    \item What problem is considered as solved by a solution
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to COMPARE various solutions?}

To answer this we have more challenges: (Sequential algorithms)

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is TIME?
    \item What is SPACE?
    \item Worst-case Analysis? Or-else
    \item Asymptotic Analysis. But Why?
\end{itemize}
