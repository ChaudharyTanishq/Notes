Comparison Operators:

String          Numeric         True if

x = y           x -eq y         x is equal to y
x != y          x -ne y         x is not equal to y
x < y           x -lt y         x is less than y
n/a             x -le y         x is less than or equal to y
x > y           x -gt y         x is greater than or equal to y
n/a             x -ge y         x is greater than or equal to y
-n x            n/a             x is not null
-z x            n/a             x is null
