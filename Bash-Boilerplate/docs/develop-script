# Tips on developing a script

1. Develop the script (or script component) as a pipeline, one step at a time,
entirely on the command line. Use bash for this process even though the
eventual interpreter might be dash or another sh variant.

2. Send output to standard output and check to be sure it looks right.

3. At each step, use the shell’s command history to recall pipelines and the
shell’s editing features to tweak them.

4. Until the output looks right, you haven’t actually done anything, so there’s
nothing to undo if the command is incorrect.

5. Once the output is correct, execute the actual commands and verify that
they worked as you intended.

6. Use fc to capture your work, then clean it up and save it.
