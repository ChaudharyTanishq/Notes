Special Characters in Regex:

Symbol                  What it matches or does

.                       Matches any character
[char]                  Matches any character from a given set
[^char]                 Matches any character not in a given set
^                       Matches from the beginning of a line
$                       Matches the end of a line
\w                      Matches any "word" character (same as [A-Za-z0-9_])
\s                      Matches any whitespace character (same as [ \f\t\n\r])
\d                      Matches any difit (same as [0-9])

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|                       Matches either the element to its left or the right
(expr)                  Limits scope, groups elements, allows matches to be 
                        captured

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

?                       Allows zero or one match of the preceding element
*                       Allows zero, one, or many matches of the preceding
                        element
+                       Allows one or more matches of the preceding element
{ n }                   Matches exactly n instances of the preceding element
{ min, }                Matches at least min instance
{ min,max }             Matches any number o instances from min to max

Note: Do not confuse * (the zero or more quantifier) with shell's globbing
character. The regex version of the star need something to modify; otherwise
it won't do what you expect. Use .* if any sequence of characters
(including no characters at all) is an acceptable match.

Captures: When a match succeeds every set of parentheses becomes a 
"capture group" that records the actual text that it matched. The exact manner
int which they are available depends on the implementation and context.
