All crontab files have the same syntax:

minute    hour    dom    month    weekday    command        

Crontab time specifications:

Field       Description             Range
-------------------------------------------------------

minute      Minute of the hour      0 to 59
hour        Hour of the day         0 to 23
dom         Day of the month        1 to 31
month       Month of the year       1 to 12
weekday     Day of the week         0 to 6 (0 = Sunday)

--> A star, which matches everything
--> A single integer, which matches exactly
--> Two integers separated by a dash, matching a range of values
--> A range followed by a slash and a step value, e.g., 1-10/2
--> A comma-separated list of integers or ranges, matching any value

If both dom and weekday are specified, only one of the two conditions needs
to be selected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> Use absolute paths in cron scripts

--> cron scripts on execution do not run .bashrc or .bash_profile. Don't expect
    the environmental variables setup there to be setup on your cron script.

--> crontab automatically checks for changes when a script is added. Do not
    add manually to cron.
